<h1>The Best Movies According to Ganesh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>Iron Man is a sure fire hit that I'm sure you won't want to miss. It has everything you could want for a comic book film: action, humor, a great cast, romance, and ultimate effects that just get you excited.</p>
<h3>Bhaubali</h3>
<p>Baahubali is one of the most visually impressive films that have come from India. Everything about this film is good - Story, direction, beautiful cinematography, haunting score and amazing visuals (though they lack some details at some places).</p>
<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>RRR has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epics/action movies, but it uses those tropes well. Things we've seen on-screen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if they're used properly, and RRR is a testament to that.</p>
